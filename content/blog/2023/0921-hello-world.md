Well, this is my first post on my new blog. I never thought I'd be blogging on github, and now here we are.

This blog is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). It differs from traditional blogs like WordPress or Blogger because GitHub Pages is a static web hosting platform. As a result, there are no databases or interactive features.

With the advent of static site generators, it is now possible to create a blogging website hosted on static web hosting. Github has its native support for static site generator with Jekyll. But I decided to use Eleventy instead. 

I'll be posting everything about programming and technology here. Hopefully, I can overcome procrastination and start blogging again. Also, I'll be migrating my old posts from my previous defunct blog.  

See you
