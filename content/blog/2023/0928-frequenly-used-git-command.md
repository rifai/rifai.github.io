While using a GUI client for Git is helpful and user-friendly, the command-line interface, although more complex, offers greater power and speed. I've written this post to serve as a handy reference, eliminating the need to repeatedly search for specific commands on Google or Stack Overflow. 
Here's a list of Git commands I use frequently, as well as some less common ones

### Create empty repository
```bash
git init 
```

### Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://repo-url.com 
```

### Status
```bash
git status
```

### Add file(s)
```bash
git add <file1> <file2> <file3>
git add .  
```

### Commit 
```bash
git commit â€“m "<message here>"
```

Will edit later
