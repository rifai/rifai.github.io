Five years ago, I introduced the prototype game 'Fat Astro,' a unique blend of gaming elements inspired by 'Boxboy' and 'Captain Toad'. Today, I decided to continue the game, this time harnessing the power of Godot Engine.

The previous game engine had become stagnant, leading me to explore the most promising open-source alternative available. This week, I've made basic character movement and walking mechanics. While there may not be much gameplay to showcase at this moment, here's a sneak peek of the progress.

I promise will update the progress more frequently.
