Unity's default Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is Visual Studio, but as I mentioned in a <a href="/blog/2023/1020-using-godot-with-vscode">previous post</a>, I prefer Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for its efficiency.

I've found that using Visual Studio only for Unity projects can be a bit overkill, and it can consume significant storage. In contrast, VSCode is much lighter, making it an excellent choice for Unity3D.

To make the switch, follow these steps:

# Unity
1. Open Unity **Preferences**.
2. Under **External Tools**, select **Visual Studio Code** as your **External Script Editor**.

# VSCode
Install the Unity extension from Microsoft at <https://aka.ms/vscode-unity>.

With these adjustments, you're all set to start editing with Visual Studio Code.
