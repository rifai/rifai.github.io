**Description** :  
She and the Light Bearer is a point and click adventure game, a poem, a  fairy tale. Take a journey inside a vibrantly colored forest, meet silly  creatures, listen to serene folk music, and discover somber secrets. 

**Released** : 2019

**Platform** : [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/658590/She_and_the_Light_Bearer/)

**Technology Used** :  
- Unity3D (Game engine with C#)
- Fungus (Unity Framework for Visual Novel aspect of the game)

**Role** :  
I worked as a contract programmer at Mojiken Studio, contributing to a Unity3D game project. While the game incorporated elements of Fungus, it diverged from the conventional visual novel format. In my role, I designed and implemented several mini-games, seamlessly integrating them into the Fungus system. I dedicated two years to this project, ensuring its successful development and functionality.
