I never thought I'd be blogging on github, and now here we are.</p>\n<p>This blog is hosted using <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> and built with <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a>. It differs from traditional blogs like WordPress or Blogger because GitHub Pages is a static web hosting platform. As a result, there are no databases or interactive features.</p>\n<p>With the advent of static site generators, it is now possible to create a blogging website hosted on static web hosting. Github has its native support for static site generator with Jekyll. But I decided to use Eleventy instead.</p>\n<p>I'll be posting everything about programming and technology here. Hopefully, I can overcome procrastination and start blogging again.</p>\n<p>See you</p>\n",
